# Pull Request: Adding Advanced ArXiv Integration to ScholarAgent

## Overview

This PR adds comprehensive arXiv integration to ScholarAgent, enabling deep research capabilities including paper metadata retrieval, LaTeX source download, content extraction, and persistent storage.

## Features Added

- **Complete Paper Metadata**: Fetch detailed paper information including authors, categories, DOI, and more
- **LaTeX Source Download**: Download and extract the actual LaTeX source files
- **Content Analysis**: Extract equations, algorithms, and other content from papers
- **SQLite Database**: Built-in persistence requiring no external servers
- **Enhanced UI**: Optional specialized UI for paper analysis and database exploration

## Changes Included

This PR includes:

1. **New Files:**
   - `tools/advanced_arxiv_tool.py` - The main tool implementation
   - `custom_gradio_ui.py` - Optional enhanced UI
   - `run_scholaragent.py` - Easy launch script

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `prompts.yaml` - Updated to include instructions for the new tool
   - `app.py` - Updated to initialize and use the new tool

## How to Use

Basic usage:
```python
from tools.advanced_arxiv_tool import AdvancedArxivTool

# Initialize the tool
arxiv_tool = AdvancedArxivTool(download_path="./papers")

# Add to your agent
agent = CodeAgent(
    model=model,
    tools=[final_answer, web_search, arxiv_tool],
    # ... other parameters
)
```

Run with enhanced UI:
```bash
python run_scholaragent.py --download-path ./papers --share
```

## Testing Performed

- ✅ Tested with valid and invalid arXiv IDs/URLs
- ✅ Verified correct paper metadata retrieval
- ✅ Confirmed LaTeX source download and extraction
- ✅ Validated SQLite database creation and querying
- ✅ Tested UI integration and enhanced interface
- ✅ Verified compatibility with existing ScholarAgent features

## Implementation Details

- Uses Python's built-in `sqlite3` module for zero additional dependencies
- Implements the smolagents `Tool` interface for seamless integration
- Provides structured error handling and response formatting
- Respects arXiv's rate limits with 3-second delays between API calls
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing codebase

## Documentation

This PR includes:

1. **User Guide**: Instructions for end-users on how to use the new features
2. **Developer Guide**: Technical documentation for extending and customizing the tool
3. **Code Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and comments

## Dependencies

The implementation has minimal dependencies:
- Python's built-in `sqlite3` module
- Standard libraries (`urllib`, `xml.etree`, `tarfile`, etc.)
- All existing ScholarAgent dependencies

## Optional Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `advanced_arxiv_tool.py` to your project's `tools` directory
3. Update your `prompts.yaml` file
4. Update your `app.py` to import and initialize the tool
5. (Optional) Add the enhanced UI components

I've designed this PR to be as minimally invasive as possible while providing significant new capabilities. You can choose to accept just the core tool implementation if you prefer, or the complete package with the enhanced UI. Let me know if you'd like any clarification or have feedback!
