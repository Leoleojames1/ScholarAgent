# Advanced ArXiv Integration for ScholarAgent

This PR adds a comprehensive arXiv integration tool to the ScholarAgent, significantly enhancing its capabilities for academic research.

## Features Added

- **Complete Paper Metadata**: Fetch detailed information about papers including title, authors, abstract, categories, DOI, and more
- **LaTeX Source Download**: Download and extract the LaTeX source files from arXiv papers
- **Content Extraction**: Parse and analyze LaTeX content from papers
- **SQLite Database**: Built-in persistent storage using SQLite - no server setup required!
- **Database Explorer**: New UI tab to explore downloaded papers
- **Enhanced UI**: New tab in the Gradio interface for deep paper analysis

## Benefits

- **Deeper Research Capabilities**: Allows users to not just find papers but analyze their content in detail
- **Code Base Access**: Provides access to the actual LaTeX source code of papers, enabling formula extraction and deeper analysis
- **Persistence**: Allows for building a local database of papers and their content
- **Zero Configuration**: Uses SQLite which requires no server setup - everything works out of the box
- **Extensibility**: Designed with a clean Tool interface that integrates seamlessly with the SmolAgents framework

## Implementation

The implementation follows best practices for the SmolAgents framework:

1. Created a new `AdvancedArxivTool` class that implements the `Tool` interface
2. Added comprehensive documentation and examples
3. Uses SQLite for lightweight but powerful persistent storage
4. Maintained full backward compatibility with the existing ScholarAgent
5. Added proper error handling and logging

## How to Use

```python
# Basic usage
from advanced_arxiv_tool import AdvancedArxivTool

# Initialize the tool - SQLite DB created automatically
arxiv_tool = AdvancedArxivTool(download_path="./papers")

# With custom database path
arxiv_tool = AdvancedArxivTool(
    download_path="./papers",
    db_path="./custom_location.db"
)

# Add to agent
agent = CodeAgent(
    model=model,
    tools=[final_answer, arxiv_tool, web_search],
    ...
)

# Example prompts:
# "Get detailed information about the paper 2403.12345"
# "Download the LaTeX source for arXiv:2311.12462 and extract key equations"
# "Analyze the mathematical formulations in paper 2402.17764"
# "Search the database for papers about quantum computing"
```

## Testing

- Tested with both valid and invalid arXiv IDs/URLs
- Verified LaTeX source extraction works with different archive formats
- Confirmed SQLite integration stores data correctly
- Tested UI integration and database explorer

## Dependencies

- No new dependencies required - uses Python's built-in sqlite3 module
- All core functionality works with the existing dependencies

I'd be happy to address any feedback or questions about this integration.
